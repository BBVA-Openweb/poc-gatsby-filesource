As of today, Openweb proyects will be created using the new corporate CDN: *Akamai*

This does not mean our beloved, yet old but reliable Amazon based CDN,
Cloudfront, will be discontinued. We will keep it and will be behind Akamai. It
will be used for both, revision environment and the edition one (if you should
happen to have one) as a protection for the latter.
